# Shared Claude Code Skills

> Source: https://github.com/isnbh0/shared

A collection of reusable Claude Code skills and command aliases. This file instructs LLMs on how to install skills from this repository into a user's project.

## Available Skills

### interview
Structured requirements discovery through conversational interviews. Extracts requirements, constraints, and design decisions through guided Q&A. Produces timestamped synthesis documents.

Invocation: `/interview <topic> [--ref <path>] [--workspace <dir>]`

### spec-workflow
Two-phase specification and implementation workflow that separates planning from execution. Write specs, get them reviewed, then implement against them.

Invocation: `/spec-workflow <write|write-phased|implement> [args...] [--workspace <dir>]`

Includes command aliases: `/write-spec`, `/write-spec-phased`, `/implement-spec`

### report-writer
Structured technical analysis and debugging reports with standardized sections (Executive Summary, Key Findings, Root Cause Analysis, Recommendations).

Invocation: `/report-writer [topic] [--workspace <dir>]`

### rigorous-debug
Evidence-based debugging protocol using the scientific method. Enforces hypothesis-driven investigation with controlled experiments. Requires one-time project-specific initialization before first use.

Invocation: `/rigorous-debug`

### skill-writer
Tools and guidance for creating effective Claude Code skills following best practices.

Invocation: `/skill-writer`

### phaser
Battle-tested patterns and best practices for Phaser 3 game development. Passive knowledgebase — automatically consulted when writing Phaser code. Covers scene architecture, physics, animations, input, object pooling, performance, and more.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

The target project must have a `.claude/` directory. Create one if it does not exist:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/project/.claude/skills
```

### Option A: Install all skills (symlink)

Clone the repository and symlink the entire `.claude` directory. This installs all skills and command aliases together.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:isnbh0/shared.git ~/shared
ln -s ~/shared/.claude /path/to/project/.claude
```

Warning: This replaces any existing `.claude` directory in the target project.

### Option B: Install individual skills (copy)

Copy only the skills the user needs. Each skill is a self-contained directory under `.claude/skills/`.

```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already cloned)
git clone git@github.com:isnbh0/shared.git ~/shared

# Copy a specific skill
cp -r ~/shared/.claude/skills/<skill-name> /path/to/project/.claude/skills/
```

### Option C: Install individual skills (symlink)

Symlink individual skills for automatic updates when the source repo is pulled.

```bash
ln -s ~/shared/.claude/skills/<skill-name> /path/to/project/.claude/skills/<skill-name>
```

### Installing command aliases

The spec-workflow skill has convenience command aliases. To use them, copy or symlink the commands directory:

```bash
# Copy
mkdir -p /path/to/project/.claude/commands
cp ~/shared/.claude/commands/*.md /path/to/project/.claude/commands/

# Or symlink individual commands
ln -s ~/shared/.claude/commands/write-spec.md /path/to/project/.claude/commands/
ln -s ~/shared/.claude/commands/write-spec-phased.md /path/to/project/.claude/commands/
ln -s ~/shared/.claude/commands/implement-spec.md /path/to/project/.claude/commands/
```

## Skill Dependencies

Each skill is fully self-contained. There are no cross-skill dependencies. Install only what you need.

The command aliases (`write-spec`, `write-spec-phased`, `implement-spec`) depend on the `spec-workflow` skill being installed.

## Workspace Configuration

Skills that produce files (interview, spec-workflow, report-writer) write to configurable workspace directories. Defaults:

| Skill | Default workspace |
|-------|-------------------|
| interview | `agent-workspace/interviews` |
| spec-workflow | `agent-workspace/specs` |
| report-writer | `agent-workspace/reports` |

Override precedence (highest to lowest):

1. CLI flag: `--workspace <dir>`
2. User config: `~/.claude/skills/<skill>/config.yaml`
3. Project config: `.claude/skill-configs/<skill>/config.yaml`

## Notes for LLMs

- When a user asks to "install" or "add" a skill, prefer Option B (copy) unless they specifically want auto-updates or want all skills.
- If the target project already has a `.claude` directory with existing content, never overwrite it. Merge by copying individual skills into the existing `.claude/skills/` directory.
- The `phaser` skill is large (18 knowledgebase files). Only install it if the user is working on a Phaser 3 project.
- The `rigorous-debug` skill requires a one-time initialization step after installation. Inform the user that they will need to run `/rigorous-debug` and complete the setup before it is usable.
- Always verify that the clone location (`~/shared` or user-specified) does not conflict with existing directories before cloning.
